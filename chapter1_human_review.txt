Chapter 1 — The Vision from the North

Dick sat perched on a coral ledge, his eyes fixed on the distant southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean thundered, whitecaps scattered by the wind. In front of him stretched the Karolin lagoon — vast, sapphire, and calm — where gulls circled lazily above. This forty-mile-wide coral ring cradled a sea within a sea: wild in storms, serene in sunshine. And now, it belonged to him — claimed just yesterday.

The beach bustled with life under the glaring sun. Women gathered fish, children splashed in the shallows, young men laughed and worked — his people now. The canoes pulled ashore were his; so were the great, empty houses that once housed warriors and their war vessels.

His gaze shifted from the peaceful lagoon to the canoe houses, a frown forming. He turned his back to the lagoon, facing the crashing breakers of the northern sea. Beyond that unseen horizon lay Palm Tree — beautiful, lush, and cursed. A paradise that concealed a nightmare.

Near him, little Tari — son of Le Taioi, the net-maker — looked up. A small boy, too young to understand the world, yet old enough to sense danger. Karolin’s men were gone, lost in war, and only women and children remained — vulnerable. Then, from the north, a stranger had arrived in a curious boat, accompanied by Katafa, the girl once thought lost at sea. The women, awestruck, believed the gods had sent him.

Tari, unaware of such beliefs, saw only a new and fascinating figure. And like all children, he asked with innocent boldness:

“Taori,” he said, “who are you?”

Could Dick explain? Would the boy understand?

He might have said, “I come from beyond your world. I am Dick Lestrange. I lived alone as a child on Marua, the island you call Palm Tree. I had an old sailor, Kearney, who taught me to fish and build toys. Then Katafa came, brought by the sea. She taught me your language. We lived together until a ship came with wicked men. They killed, they burned, and we escaped. The lagoon light in the sky guided us here.”

But he couldn’t say that. The name “Dick” and his childhood language were ghosts now, blurred by sun, storms, and memory. His life began with Katafa. Everything before her — Kearney, his toys, the island — had faded into dream.

He looked down at the boy and said simply, “I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” said the child. “I ask like I breathe. But grown-ups never answer Tari’s questions. Ai, the fish!” — and off he darted toward other children pulling in a net.

Dick returned his gaze northward. The child’s question had stirred old images: fire consuming the schooner, their desperate escape, the belief that he was a divine savior. But danger still lingered. The men of Palm Tree had no canoes — yet. They would build them. They would see the lagoon’s glow in the sky. They would come. Maybe not now — but someday.

Dick was native in soul, but a white man’s blood and foresight remained. He planned. He saw danger before it arrived. That’s why he had sent a canoe to bring Aioma, Palia, and Tafata — aged but masterful canoe-builders. That’s why he had watched the young men of the tribe — nearly a hundred, ready to become warriors.

And always, at the heart of it all, was Katafa — his other self. His love. His reason.

War canoes. Was he planning to defend the lagoon — or strike first, destroying the threat before it reached them?

A hand rested on his shoulder. He turned and saw Katafa. A loose strand of her dark hair fluttered in the wind like a feather. Her deep, luminous eyes weren’t on him — they stared north.

“Look,” she whispered.

Through the sea haze, Palm Tree had reappeared — a ghostly mirage on the horizon. Last night, it was visible too. Now, the smudge sharpened until the island seemed painted on the sky — beautiful, dangerous, distant.

They stood silent, side by side. Neither knew of mirages. To them, the island had come to watch them. It brought back memories: screams, fire, savage men, and a narrow escape in Kearney’s old dinghy.

Dick stared at the island — a vision of beauty and dread. They had threatened him. That was nothing.

They had threatened Katafa. That was everything.

They still did.

They would come — guided by the lagoon’s light, drawn by Karolin’s women. They had no families, no homes. Only hunger. For conquest. For her.

Dick realized the danger was greater than Palm Tree. It lurked in every sail, in every man’s greed and violence — whether savage or civilized.

For him, the world was bounded by two islands and the ocean between them. There was no England, no history, no world beyond this. But even here, he had learned the deepest truth of all: mankind’s instinct for destruction.

The mirage faded. Katafa turned and pointed south.

A canoe approached — the one he had sent. The builders had come.

Dick and Katafa stepped down from the coral ledge, feet sinking into warm white sand, walking to meet the future.
