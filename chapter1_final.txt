CHAPTER I

THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon.  Behind him, the relentless Pacific thundered, its spray a white confetti scattered by the wind. Before him, the tranquil azure lagoon of Karolin stretched—a vast expanse contained within a forty-mile coral ring, alive with the cries of circling gulls.  This breathtaking lagoon, capable of both violent storms and serene stillness, was now his. He, a newcomer, having arrived only yesterday.

The beach bustled with activity: women, children, and young men—the entire tribe—toiled under the relentless sun. They fished with nets, played games, or worked on their paraka patches; all were now his people. His were the canoes beached on the sand, his the empty houses once filled with fearsome war canoes.

His eyes shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a frown etching his brow. Turning from the tranquil lagoon, he faced the crashing waves of the outer beach and the vast northern sea. Beyond the unseen horizon lay Palm Tree Island—a paradise in a dream, yet teeming with savage devils.

Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, observed him from his coral perch. Tari understood little of the world, but he knew war had decimated Karolin's men, leaving the women, boys, and children vulnerable and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat from the northern sea had arrived, bearing this enigmatic man and Katafa, the girl lost at sea years ago. The women believed this man, sent by the gods, was their new chief.

The child knew nothing of the gods, nor did he care.  Alone with the stranger, out of earshot of his mother, he posed his question with childlike directness: “Taori,” little Tari asked, “who are you?”

Could Dick have answered truthfully? Could the child have understood the strange tale?  He might have said, “Tari, I come from a world beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange, and as a child smaller than you, I was stranded on Marua (Palm Tree Island), fifty miles north, with an old sailor named Kearney. He taught me to fish, to spearfish, and crafted toys for me—little ships unlike your island canoes. Then, long ago, Katafa arrived, the girl lost in the storm. We lived together until Kearney died, then just she and I. She taught me your language. She named me Taori; we loved each other and might have lived forever on Marua, had not a ship arrived, filled with wicked men from the eastern Melanesian islands. They came to cut down the trees, murdered the white men with them, and burned the ship. We escaped in our boat, taking everything we cherished, even my little ships, and guided by the lagoon’s light, we came to Karolin.”

But he couldn't tell Tari this, not all of it. The name "Dick" had faded from his memory, along with the language of his childhood. Kearney, his foster father, was almost a ghost, lost in the luminous haze of his past. For the shipwrecked and alone, the past blurs, fogs. For Dick, his life began only with Katafa's arrival on Marua; before that, everything was lost, consumed by the intense tropical light, the island's storms, and the mists of the rainy season. Only Kearney's little ships remained, tangible reminders of a forgotten past.

He looked down at the questioning child. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," the child replied. "I ask as I breathe, but the grown-ups—*madyana*—never answer Tari’s questions.  Ai, the fish!"  His attention was instantly diverted by children hauling in a net, and he scampered away.

Dick's gaze returned to the north. The child's question stirred his memory. He saw again the schooner at Palm Tree, consumed by Melanesian fire; he saw his escape with Katafa in Kearney's old dinghy; their arrival on this beach, and the swarming women and children who saw him as a god-sent leader. But the memory of his escape, the violence, stained the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate threat from the men who had seized Palm Tree; they lacked canoes. But they would build them—inevitably—and they would see Karolin's lagoon shimmering on the horizon, as he had. They would come. It might take time, but they would come.

Dick was a kanaka, a native, yet the white man remained within him. He could plan, strategize, imagine. That's why he’d sent a canoe to the southern beach that morning, for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, old men unfit for war but master canoe builders. That's why, watching the tribe, his eyes had lit upon the nearly hundred young men reaching fighting age. And underlying it all, fueling his daring, was his love for Katafa, his other self, ever-so-vaguely threatened.

War canoes! Would he defend the lagoon? Would he attack first, destroying the threat at its source? The answer remained uncertain.

A hand fell on his shoulder. Turning, he saw Katafa. A dark tress escaped the vine binding her hair, blowing back like an eagle’s feather. Her luminous dark eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the northern horizon.

"Look!" Katafa whispered.

Under certain conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became visible through a mirage.  They had seen it last night, and now it reappeared: a faint smudge on the southern sky, a dull spot in the sea's brilliance, gradually sharpening until, as if painted by an unseen hand, the island materialized—a vision of ethereal beauty.

Hand on shoulder, they stood silently, their untutored minds unaware of the mirage, their eyes fixed on the scene of their escape, now eerily rising from the distant sea. They saw the savages on the beach, monstrous figures from a nightmare; they felt the wind in their sails as the dinghy fled, heard the yells of the rum-crazed Melanesians.  The lovely picture masked the lurking demons.

As Dick gazed upon this beauty, this warning, his nostrils flared, his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him—that was nothing. They had threatened Katafa—that was everything. And they still threatened her.

One day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to confirm his instinct. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's reflection in the sky, and they would come. Those men had no women, and Karolin’s women were there.  He sensed that just as he was drawn to Katafa, these men would be drawn to Karolin’s women. They would scan the horizon, see the lagoon's light, and come.

He knew, then, that danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, and hatred might roam that azure sea—not only amongst savages, but also within the wolves of civilization.

For Dick, the world was limited to the waters surrounding the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history beyond his short life and Katafa's. Yet, even in that short life, he had learned to fear men, to understand the foundation of all history: man's instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

Gradually, the vision of Palm Tree faded, vanishing like a snuffed candle. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.  It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand to meet it.
